#### - What I used technologies to build Frontend Task?

The important things I used to create Frontend Task are (ReactJS v18.2.0, TypeScript 4.9, Material UI v5.11.1, State Management ( ReduxToolkit ), and more...)

#### - What the project contains

- Using MUI to create a ui for the project.
- Add the ability to change languages and direction for the all pages
- Enable local storage to save the direction and language for the user
- Using mui to sort the tables
- And more

#### - Setup and using it:

To install Frontend Task to your computer it's easy you can clone it and just type `npm i` to your terminal
Do what you need to add to it or update it or anything you need and update it again
It's so welcomed to work with me to add new features to it
